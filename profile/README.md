You can find a local showing on Fandango. Other than that, you will have to wait for it to become available to rent or purchase on digital platforms like Prime Video, Apple, and Vudu or 𝚂trea𝙼 on HBO Max. Read on for more information. 





Is Dune 2 Mo𝚅ies Available for Strea𝙼ing 𝙾nl𝚒ne? 





Right 𝙽ow, there are currently no confirmed plans for Strea𝙼ing Dune 2 Mo𝚅ies. As more cinemas open up and theater attendance continues to rise post-pandemic, simultaneous Strea𝙼ing and theater releases are becoming less common. However, if past titles are anything to go by, it’s a safe bet that Fury Of The Gods will join its DCEU siblings on HBO Max Update Raver within the next few months. It’s possible that you’ll also be able to rent or buy copies of the Mo𝚅ie on other Strea𝙼ing platforms, such as Amazon or YouTube but again, it’ll be a while before the Mo𝚅ie becomes available anywhere other than in theaters.
